the main hook is in Cmm.hs

// if stack space 8 is default value , you can omit it in the pretty printer or support somehow in the parser

text comes in -> data structure . data structure -> pretty_printer

//entry_code vs jump in the parser
//call in the paser

is it the same data strucutre?

how to extend the parseable syntax to support the extra information .
