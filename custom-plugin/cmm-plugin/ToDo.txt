One of the internal types of CmmType (CmmCat ) is not exported, not 
even as an abstract data type

IndexedCCFlavour is not exported at all



As mentioned previously. Some of the types cant be encode/decoded to json. Because GHC hides said types. 
To elaborate , many types in GHC are exported in a restricted way ( these are called abstract data types ). For these,
You are at the mercy of using manually written functions, to access internal values for GHC types, and form said types
from their internal values. This makes writing json encoding/decoding harder, but also , if a type doesnt have 
enough accessor or construction functions, then its impossible to fully encode or decode them.

To enable a full implementation . I plan to modify GHC and expose the automatic data constructors for the types that absolutely need it. 
After figuring this out , will then merge this changes into GHC. This will allow the plugin to be used with mainline compiler
