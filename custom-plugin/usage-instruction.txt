-Run stack build under cmm-plugin

- Run  ( find . -type f -name "libcmm-plugin.so" )  under cmm-plugin . Use the output to replace
the path at the end of the stack file in plugin-tester2

-Run stack build under plugin-tester2

Note: This last step compiles the code under plugin-tester2 with the plugin defined by cmm-plugin. The plugin 
converts all Cmm variables to json and the attempts to convert them back into Cmm ( see stgToCmmFun in plugin.hs )
Depending on the setup the serialization and deserialization ( also called serde by this project ) Should either fail
or succeed but the result make GHC crash.
Some types are incomplete.
