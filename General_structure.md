Cmm is a polymorphic structure or set of related structures that share definitions ( the different variants have their own top level definitions but share innards ) .

Said Intermediate Representation / set of IRs is meant to be used as a backend from higher level languages and compile to machine code. Much like llvm would be

In practice Cmm is : 
Compiled from STG ( a GHC IR ) 
or
Parsed from a textual version of cmm ( which cant represent everyhting cmm can ? ) , which can optionally implement some high level featuers

And then directly compiled to machine code , to wasm via a route similar to the prior or to llvm.
or
Be pretty printed to a textual cmm version that is bafflingly different from the parseable one




Here's the concise list of key Cmm-related files in GHC:

    Parsing

        compiler/GHC/Cmm/Parser.y: Parses textual .cmm files.

The top level parsing function

parseCmmFile :: CmmParserConfig
             -> Module
             -> HomeUnit
             -> FilePath
             -> IO (Messages PsMessage, Messages PsMessage, Maybe (DCmmGroup, [InfoProvEnt]))
parseCmmFile cmmpConfig this_mod home_unit filename =

Takes textual cmm and outputs a form of serialized cmm : https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/compiler/GHC/Cmm.hs

    STG â†’ Cmm

        compiler/GHC/StgToCmm.hs: Main driver for STG-to-Cmm translation.

        compiler/GHC/StgToCmm/Expr.hs: Translates STG expressions to Cmm.

    Cmm Optimizations

        compiler/GHC/Cmm/Pipeline.hs: Coordinates Cmm optimization passes.

    Backends

        Native Code: compiler/GHC/CmmToAsm.hs

        LLVM: compiler/GHC/CmmToLlvm.hs

        ## WASM: (Experimental, external repos e.g., ghc-wasm-meta).

        https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/compiler/GHC/CmmToAsm/Wasm.hs

        https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/tree/master/compiler/GHC/CmmToAsm/Wasm
        
    Cmm Syntax

        ## compiler/GHC/Cmm/Syntax.hs: Core Cmm AST definitions.

        https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/compiler/GHC/Cmm.hs

        ( The pretty printer is also defined there ) 

    Utilities

       compiler/GHC/Cmm/Node.hs: Cmm node analysis/manipulation.
       
       compiler/GHC/Cmm/Lint.hs: Validates Cmm invariants.

Questions? 

Does every programatically generated cmm code is low level? I think high level code is only used in manually writtten RTS code 
Is high level cmm entirely defined and implemented in parser.y?

Csaba: Cmm has and add with carry primitive. Which STG code generator uses, however the textual cmm cant use it in any way

Direction : 

Documennt the variations of cmm and which piece of code uses which variation. For example the parser uses variation A. The pretty printer uses B,  the native code 
generator uses C, the llvm generator uses D
The STG to cmm uses E  

Documment the variations between the parser and pretty printer
