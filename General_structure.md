Cmm is a polymorphic structure or set of related structures that share definitions ( the different variants have their own top level definitions but share innards ) .

Said Intermediate Representation / set of IRs is meant to be used as a backend from higher level languages and compile to machine code. Much like llvm would be

In practice Cmm is : 
Compiled from STG ( a GHC IR ) 
or
Parsed from a textual version of cmm ( which cant represent everyhting cmm can ? ) , which can optionally implement some high level featuers

And then directly compiled to machine code , to wasm via a route similar to the prior or to llvm.
or
Be pretty printed to a textual cmm version that is bafflingly different from the parseable one




Here's the concise list of key Cmm-related files in GHC:

    Parsing

        compiler/GHC/Cmm/Parser.y: Parses textual .cmm files.

The top level parsing function

parseCmmFile :: CmmParserConfig
             -> Module
             -> HomeUnit
             -> FilePath
             -> IO (Messages PsMessage, Messages PsMessage, Maybe (DCmmGroup, [InfoProvEnt]))
parseCmmFile cmmpConfig this_mod home_unit filename =

Takes textual cmm and outputs a form of serialized cmm : https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/compiler/GHC/Cmm.hs
